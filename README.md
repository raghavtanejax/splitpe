## 💡 The Concept: 0% MDR Arbitrage

Under current Indian digital payments guidelines (NPCI & CBIC), single merchant UPI transactions exceeding **₹2,000** attract interchange/MDR fees (up to 0.4% - 1.1%) **plus an additional 18% GST** on the MDR service fee, while transactions of **₹2,000 or under remain 100% free (0% MDR & 0% GST)**.

For small kirana merchants, restaurants, and bill payers, high-ticket transactions incur compounding gateway fees and unclaimable GST. **SplitPe** programmatically solves this by algorithmically tranching any arbitrary bill (e.g. ₹6,800) into optimal sub-₹2,000 compliant micro-slices:

$$\text{Total Bill} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Tranche}_i \quad \text{where} \quad \forall i, \; \text{Tranche}_i \le ₹1,999.00$$

$$\text{Net Surcharge Paid} = 0\% \text{ MDR} + 0\% \text{ GST} = \mathbf{₹0.00}$$
